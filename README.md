# Robotic-cart-with-arm-using-ROS-Raspberry-PI-4-and-Arduino
This project will use a Raspberry PI 4 to send data via RosSerial to an Arduino Mega. It uses two cameras viewed via VNC to share the image. The robot has a manual control motor that is controlled with an Xbox One Series X controller and a manual mode that follows the yellow color detected by a camera.
